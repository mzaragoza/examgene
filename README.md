page-break-before

The page-break-before property adds a page-break before the element to which it is applied.

Note: this property is in progress of being replaced by the more generic break-before property. This new property also handles column and region breaks while being syntactically compatible with page-break-before. Thus before using page-break-before, check if you can use break-before instead.

A common use case for this is to apply it to the selector #comments so a user printing a page with comments could easily choose to print the whole document but stop before the comments cleanly.
